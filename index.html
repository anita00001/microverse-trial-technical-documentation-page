        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.<br /><br />
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>

        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </li>
        <br><br>

        <h2 id="what_you_should_already_know">What you should already know</h2>
        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
        <li>
          A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
        </li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>
          Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of
          the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
        </li><br>

        <h2 id="javascript_and_java">JavaScript and Java</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
          does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
          JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
          basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
          from LiveScript to JavaScript.<br><br>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more
          common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
          dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
          individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any
          special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
          objects, executing as loosely typed methods.<br><br>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
          to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
          protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
          parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.<br>
        </p><br>

        <h2 id="hello_world">Hello World</h2>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          <br>greetMe("World");
        </p><br>
        <p>
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
        </p><br>

        <h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
          rules.<br><br>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).<br><br>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.<br>
        </p><br>

        <h2 id="declaring_variables">Declaring Variables</h2>
        <span
          >You can declare a variable in three ways: <br><br>With the keyword var.
          For example,</span><br><br>
        <p class="none">var x = 42.</p><br>
        <span>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          <br><br>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</span><br><br>
        <p class="none">x = 42.</p><br>
        <span>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
          JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        <br><br>With the keyword let. For example,</span><br><br>
        <p class="none">let y = 13.</p><br>
        <span
          >This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.<br></span><br><br>

        <h2 id="variable_scope">Variable Scope</h2>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function. <br><br>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block
          statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local
          to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
          example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
          function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
          block, which in this case is an if statement.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="none">if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p><br>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="none">
          if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 id="global_variables">Global Variables</h2>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax. <br><br>Consequently, you
          can access global variables declared in one window or frame from
          another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For
          example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
          you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 id="constants">Constants</h2>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">const PI = 3.14;</p><br>
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.

          <br><br>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let
          block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier
          is assumed to represent a variable.

          <br><br>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function
          or variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">
          // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
          <br />WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
          <br />//statements }
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="none">
          const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 id="data_types">Data Types</h2>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
            <li>
              null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
              other variant.</li>
            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
            <li>
              Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
              unique and immutable.
            </li><br>
          </ul>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 id="if_else_statements">if else statements</h2>
        <p>
          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">
          if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
        </p><br>
        <p>
          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
          statement, including further nested if statements. <br><br>You may also
          compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions
          tested in sequence, as follows:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">
          if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
          <br />statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
          <br />statement_last; }
        </p><br>
        <p>
          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
          when nesting if statements:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">
          if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
          <br />statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
          <br />statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
          <br />statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
        </p><br>
        <p>
          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</p>
        <p>
          If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common
          practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For
          example:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</p><br><br>

        <h2 id="while_statements">while statements</h2>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">while (condition) statement</p><br>
        <p>
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
          executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
          <br><br>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
          executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
          condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
          stops and control is passed to the statement following while.

          <br><br>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... })
          to group those statements.

          <br><br>Example: <br><br>The following while loop iterates as long as n is
          less than three:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</p><br>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:<br><br>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li><br>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 id="function_declarations">Function declarations</h2>
        <p>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:<br><br>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
            curly brackets, { }.
          </li><br>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named
          square:
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">function square(number) { return number * number; }</p><br>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p><br>
        <p class="none">return number * number;</p><br>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
          changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
          globally or in the calling function.
        </p><br><br>
